Enjoy playing a round of one of the longest-running TV game shows, Jeopardy!

This browser game gives you the chance to test your trivia knowledge with categories and clues pulled from the show itself, thanks to the Jeopardy-based API at https://jservice.io/. Just click a dollar amount to reveal the clue, and click again to reveal the answer! If you're up for a second round, use the restart button at the bottom to refresh the board!

This app was built using VSCode in WSL. Starter code for the HTML and JS was provided by Springboard, and the content for clues and categories is provided by the jService API via HTML GET requests. The JS code requires the jQUERY library and was a great way to practice using destructuring, asynchronous functions, event delegation, array functions, and other coding practices.
